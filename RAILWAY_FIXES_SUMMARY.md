# Railway Deployment Fixes Summary

This document summarizes all the changes made to fix the Railway deployment issues.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Circular Import Error
**Problem**: The main error was:
```
ImportError: cannot import name 'artifacts' from partially initialized module 'skyvern.client' (most likely due to a circular import)
```

**Root Cause**: Several client modules had empty `__init__.py` files that weren't properly exporting their classes.

**Solution**: Fixed the following files:
- `skyvern/client/artifacts/__init__.py` - Added proper imports and exports
- `skyvern/client/browser_session/__init__.py` - Added proper imports and exports  
- `skyvern/client/workflows/__init__.py` - Added proper imports and exports

### 2. Railway-Specific Optimizations
**Changes Made**:
- Created `Dockerfile.railway` optimized for Railway's environment
- Created `entrypoint-railway.sh` with Railway-specific startup logic
- Created `railway.toml` configuration file
- Used `/tmp` directories for ephemeral storage
- Configured headless browser mode for better performance

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
1. **`Dockerfile.railway`** - Railway-optimized Docker configuration
2. **`entrypoint-railway.sh`** - Railway-specific startup script
3. **`railway.toml`** - Railway deployment configuration
4. **`RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT.md`** - Comprehensive deployment guide
5. **`test_railway_deployment.py`** - Deployment verification script
6. **`test_imports_only.py`** - Import structure verification script

### Modified Files
1. **`skyvern/client/artifacts/__init__.py`** - Fixed circular import
2. **`skyvern/client/browser_session/__init__.py`** - Fixed circular import
3. **`skyvern/client/workflows/__init__.py`** - Fixed circular import

## Key Features of Railway Deployment

### 1. Environment Variable Handling
- Automatically converts Railway's `DATABASE_URL` to Skyvern's `DATABASE_STRING`
- Uses Railway's provided `PORT` environment variable
- Sets appropriate defaults for Railway environment

### 2. Resource Optimization
- Multi-stage Docker build for smaller images
- Headless browser configuration for lower memory usage
- Optimized virtual display setup
- Proper cleanup on container shutdown

### 3. Railway Integration
- Health check endpoint configuration
- Restart policy configuration
- Proper signal handling for graceful shutdowns
- Railway URL detection for secrets configuration

## Deployment Steps

1. **Push code to GitHub** with the new files
2. **Create Railway project** and connect to GitHub repo
3. **Add PostgreSQL database** service in Railway
4. **Set environment variables** (API keys, etc.)
5. **Deploy** - Railway will automatically use `railway.toml` configuration

## Environment Variables Required

### Required
- `DATABASE_URL` (automatically set by Railway PostgreSQL)
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` or `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` or `GEMINI_API_KEY`
- `LLM_KEY` (e.g., `OPENAI_GPT4O`)
- `ENABLE_OPENAI=true` (or appropriate LLM provider)

### Optional
- `BROWSER_TYPE=chromium-headless` (default)
- `ENABLE_CODE_BLOCK=true`
- Bitwarden credentials (if using password manager)
- AWS credentials (if using S3 storage)

## Testing

Run the test scripts to verify everything works:
```bash
python test_imports_only.py  # Test import structure
python test_railway_deployment.py  # Full deployment test (requires dependencies)
```

## Next Steps

1. Test the deployment on Railway
2. Monitor logs for any remaining issues
3. Adjust resource allocation if needed
4. Set up monitoring and alerts

The circular import issue should now be resolved, and the application should deploy successfully on Railway.
